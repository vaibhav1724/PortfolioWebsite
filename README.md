# PortfolioWebsite
This is my personal portfolio website. It has 5 components :
1. Navigation bar or Header: It has guides you through website and has a transition while you hover over the names of sections. When clicked it will take you to the respective section. I was unable to find a logo 
                             for me so I added plain text.
2. Home section: It gives a brief overview about me and has my photo.
3. About Me section: It contains my story of how I got interested in coding. I also contains 2 sections which when clicked will display that section and hide the other one. The sectiond are:
                      a. SKILLS : This contains the logos of languages that I can understand and write code in. I have added a visual element of card and added tilting animation.
                      b. HOBBIES : This conatins the hobbies I have and also description about it. Here also I have added a visual element called Glassmorphism with tilt effect with the help of a js library   
                                   "vanilla-test.js".
4. Contact Me section: Here I have created a form and also connected it with the help of Apps Script extension to a Google Spreadsheet, so any messages you send, I will receive them. I have also added my email, 
                       phone number, github, linkdin and instagram. For the last three I have added hyperlink on the icons itself. I added the icons with the help of another js library called "font-awesome".
5. Footer : At last I have added a footer with some text and icon.
 In order to run the website, clone the complete repository and having all the images and files in one folder just launch "index.html" on chrome.
